# BME_Robotic_Finger_Project
Matlab modeling of a 4DOF robotic finger with 3 joints, with forward and inverse kinematics solution implementationl supporting GUI app. My contribution in this project concerns the forward and inverse kinematics, a low-level MATLAB implementation using the results of the first section I found in order for me to verify all the work I had done in the previous step, and a simple user interface creation in the MATLAB App Designer that uses the code I created in
MATLAB, which helps visualize the robotic finger into an end-to-end pipeline through a GUI.
