# BME_Robotic_Finger_Project
Matlab modeling of a 4DOF robotic finger with 3 joints, with forward and inverse kinematics solution implementation supporting GUI app. My contribution to this project concerns the detailed forward and inverse kinematics analytical solution for a 4DOF robotic finger, a low-level MATLAB code implementation, and a simple user interface development in the MATLAB App Designer, which helps visualize the robotic finger system as an end-to-end pipeline.
